# 👋 Hello DotWorld Team!

## 🚀 My Motivation & Project

I took on the challenge of **recreating and adapting your amazing website** in just **A day work (7 hours)** – not to steal, but to **show you my dedication and excitement** to join your team.  
I wanted to demonstrate that I **understand your vision**, and that I’m ready to put in the hard work to **align perfectly with your stack and spirit**.

---

## 🛠️ My Approach

- 🖌️ I **faithfully recreated** the layout and animations – but with my own fun twist.
- 🚫 I **avoided external libraries** (no GSAP, no Splide.js) to keep the **bundle ultra-light** and fully **vanilla-friendly**.
- 🎨 Some images are **recreated in pure CSS** – again, all about **efficiency and performance**.
- ⚡️ My stack: **Vite.js**, **Sass**, **pure JavaScript**

## 💡 Why I Did This

Please don’t see this as an attempt to **copy or steal your ideas**.  
I **love** your design. It’s inspiring and reflects a clear vision.  
Rebuilding it was my way to **showcase my motivation** and how quickly I can work. I didn’t manage to recreate everything or go as far as I wanted, but I set a 7-hour limit to challenge myself and still highlight that I’m already in tune with your values and approach.
